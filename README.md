# Lung cancer Survival Anlaysis

In this project, I analyzed clinical trial data from the cancer genome atlas program([TCGA])(https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga) to estimate the survival rates for two kinds of non-small cell lung cancer. Additionally, I also explored demographic, pathological, and smoking history characteristics of patients to identify statistically significant covariates that influence survival rates.

Requirements to run the R/Rmd scripts:
R 3.6.1
Packages: survival, survminer, RTCGA, RTCGA.clinical, tidyverse, ggplot2, tigerstats, broom, kableExtra packages 

The Rmd file was used to generate the html report thats on my [website](https://smakeneni.github.io/portfolio/Lungcanceranalysis.html)
