# SurvivalAnlaysis

In this project, I analyzed clinical trial data from the cancer genome atlas program to estimate the survival rates for two kinds of non-small cell lung cancer. Additionally, I also explored demographic, pathological, and smoking history characteristics of patients to identify statistically significant covariates that influence survival rates.

I used survival, survminer, RTCGA, RTCGA.clinical packages in R for this project. 

The Rmd file was used to generate the html report thats on my website
